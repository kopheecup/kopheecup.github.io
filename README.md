# (2025)THE FUTURE IS HERE
I made this repo in back in 2020 and it is 2025 so it's time for a REHAUL! Pulling the future plans as a check list now:

# Future Plans
- Add different collections, or group my artworks that shared similar themes.
- Add sort function on gallery.
- Add search function.
- (nope not gonna do this) ~~I might deploy this website on a different platform that supports backend codes. Currently the website is half written in Node.js and using MongoDB, you can still use ``npm start`` on your command prompt if the repo is cloned on your local device.~~
- (nah)~~IF I change where I host this website, might as well use react on front end.~~
- (IN PROGRESS) i might redo the whole thing.


# kopheecup.github.io
This is a website for my casual artworks, hosted on GitHub Pages.
