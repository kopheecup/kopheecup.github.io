		        What I do (professionally)
		      </p>
		      <p><del>nothin</del></p>
		      <p>
		        I am actually stu(dying) at the moment hueh.
		        I'm a uni student, currently studying User Design,
		        Discrete Mathematics, and Operations Research as my major(s),
		        and minoring in Computing and Graphic Design.
		        Quite a mixed bag I'd admit, but hey, I like to poke my
		        finger in every pie I came across ᕕ( ᐛ )ᕗ.
		        <br>
		        I was a Design Consultant at Momentium Consulting,
		        and worked on UI/UX based projects. Sometimes I
		        might join a tech-based project, but usually I don't do
		        the hardcore coding there, which is a huge letdown for me,
		        actually. I won't go into too much deets here,
		        this is NOT my resume website : ) I made this for fun.
		        And talking about work is NOT fun : )
		        <br>
		        More links may (MAY) be put up for each section on my works,
		        so stay tuned :D
		      </p>

		      </del></p>
		      <p>
		        I draw. uh. yeh. in case you haven't been to the
		        <a>homepage</a>,
		        there's a <a>gallery</a> of mine.
		        <br>
		        <br>
		        Ofc, my life is a joke, and I have the music to go with it ; )
		        <br>
		        I play the clarinet in my uni's wind ensemble,
		        and proudly a TwoSet Violin fan eventhough I don't have my
		        40 hours/day of practice (´°̥̥̥̥̥̥̥̥ω°̥̥̥̥̥̥̥̥｀) I'M WORKING ON IT.
		        <br>
		        <br>
		        Though not well, I also play the piano, and a little bit of
		        guitar. yeh you get the "finger in many pies" thing now do you?
		        I'm also learning to play the flute at the moment, idk how i cope but yeh.
		        <br>
		        <br>
		        hmmm. something else about me?
		        <br>
		        if you're reading this far then i guess the answer is yes?
		        well if you say no then the close button is always there for you : )
		        <br>
		        <br>
		        Anyway, I'm also interested in languages and stuff,
		        it'll be easier to show you in a list:

		        <ul id="languages">
		          <li>廣东话</li>
		          <li>Bahasa Malaysia</li>
		          <li>python</li>
		          <li>c</li>
		          <li>SQL</li>
		          <li>English</li>
		          <li>JavaScript</li>
		          <li>中文</li>
		          <li>MATLAB (controversial i know)</li>
		          <li>Tex</li>
		        </ul>

		        I'm also learning Japanese, Hokkien,
		        and having Korean on my list (aka haven't started but intend to) ᕕ( ᐛ )ᕗ

		      <p>
		        literally the love(s) of my life.
		        <br>
		        Our eldest is Blacky, she was stray that just
		        wondered into our house back in 2008 and...stayed. ever since.
		        Smart and cheeky, she loves chewing on ice (weird i know),
		        sitting inside the house and looking at the garden for hours,
		        running away from home,
		        and of course, belly rubs.
		        <br>
		        Then we have Double, he was adopted via our local SPCA in 2014,
		        and likes sleeping in inconspicuous places. He lives in our backyard,
		        chillin' every single day. A little dense and clumsy,
		        he eats basically everything presented in front of him and enjoys
		        soft pets.
		        <br>
		        They both despise showers and it is always a big work trying to
		        catch em for showering (´°̥̥̥̥̥̥̥̥ω°̥̥̥̥̥̥̥̥｀)
