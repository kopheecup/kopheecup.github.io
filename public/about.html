          <br>

          and a walking meme.
          <br>

          What I do (professionally)
        </p>
        <p><del>nothin</del></p>
        <p>
          I am actually stu(dying) at the moment hueh.
          I'm a uni student, currently studying User Design,
          Discrete Mathematics, and Operations Research as my major(s),
          and minoring in Computing and Graphic Design.
          Quite a mixed bag I'd admit, but hey, I like to poke my
          finger in every pie I came across ᕕ( ᐛ )ᕗ.
          <br>
          I was a Design Consultant at Momentium Consulting,
          and worked on UI/UX based projects. Sometimes I
          might join a tech-based project, but usually I don't do
          the hardcore coding there, which is a huge letdown for me,
          actually. I won't go into too much deets here,
          this is NOT my resume website : ) I made this for fun.
          And talking about work is NOT fun : )
          <br>
          More links may (MAY) be put up for each section on my works,
          so stay tuned :D
        </p>

          I draw. uh. yeh. in case you haven't been to the
          <a href="../index.html">homepage</a>,
          there's a <a href="../index.html">gallery</a> of mine.
          <br>
          <br>
          Ofc, my life is a joke, and I have the music to go with it ; )
          <br>
          I play the clarinet in my uni's wind ensemble,
          and proudly a TwoSet Violin fan eventhough I don't have my
          40 hours/day of practice (´°̥̥̥̥̥̥̥̥ω°̥̥̥̥̥̥̥̥｀) I'M WORKING ON IT.
          <br>
          <br>
          Though not well, I also play the piano, and a little bit of
          guitar. yeh you get the "finger in many pies" thing now do you?
          I'm also learning to play the flute at the moment, idk how i cope but yeh.
          <br>
          <br>
          hmmm. something else about me?
          <br>
          if you're reading this far then i guess the answer is yes?
          well if you say no then the close button is always there for you : )
          <br>
          <br>
          Anyway, I'm also interested in languages and stuff,
          it'll be easier to show you in a list:

          <ul id="languages">
            <li>廣东话</li>
            <li>Bahasa Malaysia</li>
            <li>python</li>
            <li>c</li>
            <li>SQL</li>
            <li>English</li>
            <li>JavaScript</li>
            <li>中文</li>
            <li>MATLAB (controversial i know)</li>
            <li>Tex</li>
          </ul>

          I'm also learning Japanese, Hokkien,
          and having Korean on my list (aka haven't started but intend to) ᕕ( ᐛ )ᕗ

          literally the love(s) of my life.
          <br>
          Our eldest is Blacky, she was stray that just
          wondered into our house back in 2008 and...stayed. ever since.
          Smart and cheeky, she loves chewing on ice (weird i know),
          sitting inside the house and looking at the garden for hours,
          running away from home,
          and of course, belly rubs.
          <br>
          Then we have Double, he was adopted via our local SPCA in 2014,
          and likes sleeping in inconspicuous places. He lives in our backyard,
          chillin' every single day. A little dense and clumsy,
          he eats basically everything presented in front of him and enjoys
          soft pets.
          <br>
          They both despise showers and it is always a big work trying to
          catch em for showering (´°̥̥̥̥̥̥̥̥ω°̥̥̥̥̥̥̥̥｀)
